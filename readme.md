# Rainforest Components

Set of standards-based web components following the [Cloudscape Design System](https://cloudscape.design).

## Why?

When I started at Amazon Web Services (AWS), I had ideas for projects I wanted to build. This is in fact a core operational behavior at Amazon called "mechanisms". In order to build a UI for my projects, I wanted to leverage the corporate design system, Cloudscape (previously Polaris). The design system is based on React, which as a web standards purist was a bridge I was just not willing to cross.

I asked the Cloudscape team if they had a web components version planned and if I could contribute to such a project. The response I got was "Why would we ever consider web components?" This is a direct quote, and this response blows my mind. Why would we ever use web standards? 

Why would you ever consider React?

Okay, so the answer was a clear "No". Well, I guess I will just have to do it myself. And here we are. If your skill level includes some HTML and some JavaScript, Rainforest can help you build a Cloudscape-themed application. Or at the very least, get you a bad ass proof of concept. üí•

I have used the Rainforest components to build AWS-internal applications. They work well in the "real world". Where feasible the project aims for feature/API parity (with the occassional exceptions).

## Wait. Why?

- Web standards
- Minimal barrier to entry
- Easy to get started
- Easy to use
- No framework required
- No build required
- Works with frameworks

> This is a personal passion project. ‚ù§Ô∏è It is not sponsored by Amazon. It is not sanctioned by Amazon. It is not affiliated with Amazon. I just happen to be an Amazon employee that wanted a web components version of the Cloudscape components for his internal projects.

## Some Differences to Consider

Cloudscape uses the React framework. There are ideomatic ways in which React is used. Some of these constructs do not suit web standards well. There are ideomatic ways that web components are used as well. Where those differences are significant is discussed in the following sections. Otherwise Rainforest aims for feature/API parity.

### A Dash of Prefix

Web components are required to have a prefix to avoid collision in naming. You might use a `Button` web component from one project, and then a `Calendar` component from another, where the `Calendar` uses a `Button` as well - a button from its own project. Which `Button` should be used where? Prefixing avoids this collision. 

The prefix for Rainforest is `rf-`. Open and close tags are required for web components.

``` html
<rf-button>Button</rf-button> <!-- HTML -->
<Button>Button</Button> <!-- Cloudscape/React -->
```

### Controls vs Containers vs Components  

Composition is an important concept for web components. The ability of one component to hold other components, and potentially change how they are rendered. This concept surfaces in React and thus in Cloudscape as well. Within Rainforest, there are two groupings of **components**; there are **controls** and there are **containers**. Controls are elements the user interacts with directly, while containers are responsible for layout.

When a components are not differentiated, there is often a "comp" or "components" directory with the project structure. Web components are often used as building blocks in components for custom applications. Those application components oten need a directory structure all their own. Differentiating between "control" and "container" frees up the "components" directory to contain pieces pertinent to that application implmentation.
